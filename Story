Project Story: University Assistant Chatbot - Thor
Welcome to the University Assistant Chatbot project! This project aims to create a helpful, interactive chatbot named Thor, designed to assist university students with various needs. Thor provides information on enrollment and registration, course details, financial information, campus resources, and contact information.

Background
University students often have numerous questions and need quick access to information related to their academic and campus life. To address this, we decided to build a chatbot that can provide immediate answers to common questions. This project is particularly useful for new students navigating their way through university processes for the first time.

Objectives
The primary objectives of the Thor chatbot are:

Provide Immediate Assistance: Thor answers common queries related to university processes and resources.
Enhance Student Experience: By providing accurate and timely information, Thor helps improve the overall student experience.
Reduce Administrative Load: By handling frequently asked questions, Thor helps reduce the workload on university administrative staff.
Features
Thor is equipped to handle queries in the following areas:

Enrollment and Registration: Information on how to enroll, required documents, and registration fee details.
Course Details: Guidance on where to find the course catalog, how to select courses, and course orientation details.
Financial Information: Assistance with applying for financial aid, information on scholarships and grants, and tuition fees and payment options.
Campus Resources: Information on accessing library resources, student health center services, and career services and job placements.
Contact Information: Providing email contacts for key university offices.
How It Works
The chatbot is implemented in Python and interacts with users through text-based input and output. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the functionality:

Introduction: Thor introduces himself and lists the areas he can assist with.
Main Menu: Users can select from a menu of topics to get specific information.
Sub-Menus: Each topic has its own set of questions and answers. Users can navigate these sub-menus to find the information they need.
Links and Contact Information: Thor provides relevant links and contact information to ensure users can access detailed resources and support.
Code Structure
The code is structured into several functions, each handling a specific part of the interaction:

introduce(): Thor's introduction and main capabilities.
enrollment_and_registration(): Answers queries related to enrollment and registration.
course_details(): Provides information on course details.
financial_information(): Answers financial-related queries.
campus_resources(): Provides information on campus resources.
contact_information(): Gives contact details for various university offices.
